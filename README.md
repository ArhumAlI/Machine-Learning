# Machine-Learning

Three ML models implemented on Mnist Dataset.

- Some basic preprocessing is done i.e. reshaping, converting into float, smoothing etc;
- Then using 1 vs all approach to impplement each of the 10 classes of mnist dataset as a separate model.
- Finally, aggregating their results as one average as the final model accuracy.
